# Lab Refrigerator Tender Evaluation – Mock Procurement Project

## Project Summary
#### This project simulates a real-life procurement scenario based on a public sector tender. The objective is to evaluate supplier offers against the technical specifications defined by the buyer (Ministry of Health) for laboratory-grade refrigerators. The process involves analyzing tender requirements, reviewing supplier documentation, comparing offers, identifying non-compliances, and preparing submission-ready documentation.

## Objective
#### To identify which supplier offers a product that is technically compliant, certified, and deliverable within the required timeframe — while maintaining clean and organized documentation that supports procurement decision-making.

## My Role

### I acted as a procurement intern whose main responsibilities included:

    Studying tender requirements (technical and regulatory)
    Extracting supplier data from datasheets and certificates
    Using Excel to build a tender comparison matrix
    Highlighting non-compliances
    Writing a short recommendation report for internal use


## Tools Used

    Microsoft Excel
    Power BI (optional dashboard)
    PDF for final report presentation

### What’s Included in This Project
    •	Tender Requirement Analysis: Breakdown of the buyer’s technical and regulatory criteria.
	•	Supplier Data Extraction: Collection and normalization of compliance data from supplier documentation.
	•	Weighted Scoring Model: Calculation of normalized weights for specifications and overall compliance scoring.
	•	Comparison Matrix: Excel-based matrix that automatically calculates compliance scores and flags non-compliances.
	•	Evaluation of Key Criteria: Includes technical specs, delivery lead time, warranty & support, certifications, and price competitiveness.
	•	Final Scoring & Ranking: Aggregation of weighted scores to rank suppliers objectively.
	•	Visualizations (optional): Power BI dashboard showcasing supplier comparisons via charts and heatmaps.
	•	Recommendation Summary: Brief insights and suggested next steps for procurement decision-makers.


## Dataset / Inputs
    - Supplier datasheets and certificates provided in PDF and Excel formats.
    - Public sector tender documents outlining technical and regulatory requirements.
    - All data normalized and entered into a structured Excel comparison matrix.

## Methodology
    - Mapped each tender requirement to a weighted score based on importance.
    - Extracted compliance data for each supplier and assigned normalized scores (0 to 1).
    - Calculated weighted compliance scores per criterion and aggregated for overall ranking.
    - Used Excel formulas to automate scoring and flag non-compliances.
    - Created visualizations in Power BI to support data-driven decision-making.


## Results
    - Supplier A achieved the highest overall compliance score of 94%.
    - Common non-compliance issues included warranty support and delivery timeline adherence.
    - Visualizations helped quickly identify supplier strengths and areas for improvement.

## Results Visualization

#### The following visualizations present a detailed breakdown of supplier compliance scores across each technical and regulatory specification. This allows for an easy comparison of how well each supplier meets the individual tender criteria, highlighting strengths and weaknesses per specification. These insights support informed decision-making by illustrating the specific areas where suppliers excel or fall short.

## Data Source

#### All tables and datasets used in this project are synthetically generated to simulate realistic procurement data based on public sector tender requirements. No confidential or proprietary information was used. The synthetic data was designed to cover typical supplier compliance scenarios and scoring variations for demonstration purposes.
